# Report
The project consists of an *Android mobile application which controls an Arduino device* equipped with wheels and proximity sensor. Communication is via bluetooth in two ways:
- Android > Arduino: to make it move forward, backward, right, left or stop it.
- Arduino > Android: to display the distance of the robot from an obstacle placed in front of it.

Some features are:
- Use of smartphone sensors to control the robot
- Calibration of these sensors
- The option of recording a route to make it run to the robot later
- A detailed development of both hardware and software.
